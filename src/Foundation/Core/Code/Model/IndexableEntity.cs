    //
    // The most clean way to go about this involves:
    //
    // 1. Getting the item being viewed
    // 2. Getting all sites
    // 3. Finding the first site for which the item falls within the tree path
    //
    // Once the site has been located, you can then use the SiteContextSwitcher to switch over to the site 
    // and work against the correct context. Once the correct context has been identified, use the LinkManager.GetUrl()
    // functionality to get the correct item url in the given context.
