	This is an example of how to configure the source folder path needed for Unicorn item serialization.

<configuration xmlns:patch="http://www.sitecore.net/xmlconfig/">
  <sitecore>
    <!--
				The source folder is where the Conjunction source code is located on your machine (the working directory).
        
        The source folder must be an absolute filesystem path, e.g. c:\projects\Conjunction\src.
        Be sure to keep the '\src' part of the path.

    <sc.variable name="sourceFolder" value="C:\path-to-source\src" />
