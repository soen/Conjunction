# Examples

Conjunction is distributed with a few examples in its source code.

## The MVC Demo Example

This example shows how you can create a minimal fuctioning Sitecore MVC web application that uses Conjunction. The example shows how you can use Conjunction from Controller Rendering that reacts to dynamic values provided by the query string by the end-user, whereas the results are passed along to a view-model that is used in the presentation view to show the results found that matches the query.
