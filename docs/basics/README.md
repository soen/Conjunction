# Basics

In this guide, we'll walk through the process of setting up a simple search query with a few rules to demonstrate the general principles behind configuring search queries using Conjunction. Afterwards, the guide will continue to show how you can retrieve the search results, based on the search query configuration, that matches the indexed documents within the underlying search engine technology.

* [Creating the indexable entity model](CreateIndexableEntityModel.md)
* [Configuring the search query](ConfigureSearchQuery.md)
* [Retrieving the search results](RetrieveSearchResults.md)

> **Note**: This guide assumes that you have an existing Visual Studio project, or have created one to be used by this guide. If not, start by creating a new Visual Studio Web project, and install Conjunction using the installation instructions found [here](https://soen.github.io/Conjunction/#installation-instructions).
